## Objective

This document describes usage of the `de1_dui` ("Decent User Interface") Tcl package to create the user interface 
of the Decent espresso machine DE1 app.

The DE1 app GUI is built with the [Tk toolkit](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Tk). Tk was designed for desktop 
applications, so it's not adapted to a tablet touch interface out-of-the-box, but offers enough flexibility for it to
be used. The DE1 app is one of the first usages of a viable Tcl/Tk-based tablet commercial app.

The first versions of the DE1 app (up to 1.3?) included a number of commands to help build such a user interface on top 
of Tk, offering a simple and elegant solution. This GUI infrastructure code, though, was not encapsulated in its 
own layer, and "bussines logic" was sometimes mixed with the GUI building logic. 
Also the code was not optimized for reuse and encouraged copying and pasting big chunks of code which made it 
harder and harder to maintain.

The objective of the `de1_dui` package (abbreviated DUI from now on) is to encapsulate all of the DE1 app GUI 
infrastructure functionality into its own framework layer, extending its existing mechanisms so that client code in 
skins and extensions can build new GUI pages and elements with minimal effort.

If you want to learn Tk, I highly recommend Welch & Jones' book 
[Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Book+Practical+Programming+in+Tcl+and+Tk) 
(has some outdated constructs as it's for Tcl 8.4, but still one of the best books for learning the language and 
toolkit basics), and the [TkDocs online tutorial](https://tkdocs.com/).

## History

The DE1 app was developed by [John Buckman](https://github.com/decentjohn), cofounder of [Decent Espresso](https://decentespresso.com/), and it included all the mechanisms to build an elegant platform-independent touch interface on top of Tk.

The DUI package first release was developed by [Enrique Bengoechea](https://github.com/ebengoechea) as an extension of the existing GUI infrastructure code in the DE1 app, to make skin and extension writing for the Decent espresso machine easier. It came as an spin-off from the Describe Your Espresso (DYE) plugin, which started as a DSx plugin. Migrating it to a DE1 app plugin required lots of GUI changes, so the GUI part was taken off DYE and moved to its own plugin, DGUI. Then, the interest of [Johanna](https://github.com/mimoja) encouraged Enrique to refine it and make into the core DE1 app.

Much of DUI first release took code and ideas from [Barney](https://github.com/barneyhawes)'s Metric skin, [Damian](https://github.com/damian-au)'s DSx skin, and [Johanna](https://github.com/mimoja)'s MimojaCafe skin.


<a name="overview"></a>

## Overview

DUI uses a [canvas widget](https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl/TkCmd/canvas.htm) to build the GUI. All GUI elements are
added to this canvas, whose handle can be obtained with command `dui canvas`.

Canvas as a widget offers 3 main features:

1. A drawing plane for "canvas items": text, lines, rectangles, ovals, polygons, and arcs. Some DE1 app controls are
built directly from these primitives, in order to offer a more modern-looking tablet-style interface than the standard
Tk widgets.

2. A container and geometry manager for other Tk widgets.

3. The ability to name and group elements together for creation, deletion, access, moving, etc., via the powerful tags 
mechanism.

The DUI canvas is initialized on startup and works as the Tk [geometry manager](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Geometry+Managers). All children elements (canvas items and Tk widgets, which we'll, from now on, refer to as "visual items" or "GUI elements") are positioned and sized on it using coordinates and dimensions in a fixed-size, non-scrollable space of 2560x1600 pixels.
DUI transforms all these coordinates and sizes to the actual ones depending on the current screen resolution.

The interface is organized in [pages](#pages). A page is just a named background element (either an image or a colored rectangle) with visual items added on top. Each visual item can be added to one or several pages, which allows easily building sets of similar pages that share most of their GUI elements. Pages are usually defined on startup:

1. In skins, on the outermost code that is evaluated when the code is sourced, or in procedures invoked from there.
2. In extensions, on code launched from either the `preload` or `main` namespace commands.

Nevertheless, for code clarity and proper encapsulation, creating pages directly in the outermost code is no longer recommended. Where possible, it is suggested to use the new [page namespace](#page_namespaces) mechanism instead (see below).

[GUI elements](#items) are added to pages using the `dui add <item_type> <page> <coordinates> <args>` family of 
commands, which are similar to the previous `add_de1_<item_type>` procedures. These commands are the workhorse
of DUI. They offer a *facade* to the lower-level Tk interface and add a good number of facilities on top:

1. Transform all coordinates and dimensions from a fixed-size space of 2560x1600 to the actual resolution in use.
2. *[New]* Assign meaningful labels to all visual items added to the canvas, using the canvas tag system. The labels are based 
on the first  element of the list provided by the calling code in the `-tags` argument, or on automatically-generated 
labels if `-tags` is not provided.
3. *[New]*  Assign default values to most widget creation options to define their aspect (font, colors, etc.) using themes
and styles. Client code is thus relieved from having to define each of these options on each call and aspect changes 
can be done globally with just a few lines of code.
4. If the element is a Tk widget, create the widget (which is necessary, before it can be added it to the canvas)
5. *[New]* Create extra visual items in *compound* GUI controls, such as labels for most widgets, scrollbars for listboxes and 
multiline text entries, images and icons in buttons, etc., and label all of them so they can easily be retrieved later.
6. *[New]* Create connection code between these items, if necessary. For example, dynamically place scale scrollbars on the side
of listboxes and make them work together with the listbox.
7. *[New]* Add common utilities (if requested), such as data validation or full-page editors for data input.
8. *[New]* If page namespaces are used, add references to all created visual items in the page namespace `widgets` array,
and use the namespace `data` array as default for any non-fully qualified variable used in the visual controls.
9. Add the visual items to the canvas, hidden.
10. Assign each visual item to the pages where it should appear.
11. Return the handle of the created item (canvas IDs for canvas items, and pathnames for Tk widgets)

Note that the `add_de1_<type>` commands in use before DUI only tackled the steps without *"[New]"*.
All others needed to be handled by skin/plugin code, but now are directly provided by the framework.

After the pages and all its visual elements are created, normally during app startup, they are shown during the app lifecycle using the `dui page show <page_name> <args>` command. This will hide all the canvas items of the currently visible page, and show all the canvas items of the new page. Client code can create 
callbacks that run whenever a specific page is loaded (after the `page show` command is invoked, but before the page is shown), after the page is shown, or when the page is hidden. This can be done by creating standard procs (named `load`, `show` and `hide`) in the page namespace, or by using command `dui page add_action` if page namespaces are not useed.

<a name="example"></a>

## Example

(TBD)

<a name="api"></a>

## Details and API

The `de1_dui` package offers a single command: `dui`. This is an namespace ensemble with several ensemble subcommands:
`dui theme`, `dui aspect`, `dui font`, `dui page`, `dui item` and `dui add`, each of which offers 
its own set of commands.

### Some design considerations

Most code in DUI only extends what was already there in the DE1 app, but trying to formalize everything into its own layer and generate a consistent API. Although most features are designed to be backwards compatible, the API itself has been conceived forward-looking. For example, internal consistency in naming arguments and commands has been given priority whenever it conflicted with existing argument or command names.

For theming and styling both the Tk [resource database](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/option+database) and Tk 
[themed widgets](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/styles.html) were evaluated as possible solutions, but none seemed ideal for our needs.

I also opted for building item/widget compound bundles in a very simple way: manipulate the **args** and wrap calls to create a  _facade_ . I considered other alternatives, like [overloading megawidgets](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Overloading+widgets), but that seemed to add unneeded complexity vs the simple design here, which is relatively easy to follow and still allows low-level access by client code to everything. Probably something like [snit](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcllib/doc/tcllib-1-18/embedded/www/tcllib/files/modules/snit/snit.html) would have been a very good option, but I found it too late.

Canvas-based new controls have their names prefixed by a "d" (**d**button, **d**slider, **d**checkbox, etc.) Currently they don't keep state internally, but depend on the global or namespace variable they reflect, and have all necessary parameters passed to them on the callbacks built at runtime when the are created and added to pages. This means that they are controlled indirectly by manipulating the variable, and there are no methods no modify their configuration (such as minimum and maximum values accepted) after creation. This shouldn't be hard to change in the future, if the need arises.

It is highly recommended that code in skins and extensions use as little low-level Tk functionality as possible, and try to use DUI calls instead. This should make it much more future-proof. If you find needing to write code that tweaks how DUI makes things, please consider adding your extensions to the core DUI by making a GitHub Pull Request.

As an example, using a canvas as the topmost widget is at the heart of DUI, but there are [canvas alternatives](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Alternative+Canvases) that may offer additional functionality with an almost identical API, like [tkpath](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/tkpath), so that may change in the future. You will be shielded against such a change if you always use `[dui canvas]` or `[dui item config]` instead of `.can` and `.can itemconfig`.

<a name="environment_setup"></a>

### Environment setup

In the current alpha version, DUI coexists with the previous GUI infrastructure code, sharing most of the startup
configuration, so little setup is needed. As DUI replaces existing code in forthcoming versions, more of the
environment setup will move here.

At the moment, the only required initialization is the definition of the folders where to look for images and fonts 
(DUI will look up files on each folder in the list starting by the first element until a match is found).

```tcl
dui font add_dirs "[homedir]/fonts"
dui item add_image_dirs "[homedir]/skins/Insight" "[homedir]/skins/default"
```

You can change some default behaviours with the `dui config` command, or obtain their values with `dui cget`. 
The following options are suported (`<boolean>` may be any value that can be casted to a boolean: 0/1, yes/no, 
true/false, etc. as accepted by `[string is true]`).


<a name="dui_config"></a>

**dui config**  _option value_   _?option value...?_

	Sets the value of a global dui configuration option. Most options are boolean, and its value is coerced to 0/1 using `[string is true]`. Valid options are:

- **debug_buttons** (default 1) Set to 1 while debugging to draw a border around "clickable" areas. May need to redefine the border color using aspect `<theme>.dbutton.debug_outline` to make it visible against the theme background.

- **create_page_namespaces** (default 0) Set to 1 to default to create a namespace ::dui::page::<page_name> for each new created page, unless a different namespace is provided in the `-namespace` option of `dui page add`.

- **trim_entries** (default 0) Set to 1 to trim leading and trailing whitespace from modified values in entry boxes.

- **use_editor_pages** (default 1) Set to 1 to default to use editor pages if available (currently only for numbers).


<a name="dui_cget"></a>

**dui cget**  _option_

>Returns the current value of the requested configuration option.

 
<a name="aspects"></a>

### Themes, aspects and styles

 A theme is just a name that serves as grouping for a set of aspect variables. Themes define a "visual identity", by
 setting default option values for all widgets (colors, fonts, anchoring, etc.) Each of these options is called an "aspect".

Whenever a new visual item is added to a page, the default aspects will be automatically applied to the widget or canvas 
item according to its type (text / variable / entry / listbox etc.), unless a different value is explicitly added on the 
`gui add <item_type>` call.

Furthermore, each item or widget type can have any number of styles, which are sets of options with a specific appearance. 
For example, we may define styles for text items like "tab_header", "page_title", etc. Client code only needs to add 
argument `-style tab_header` to apply all the style aspects at once, and may overwrite any individual aspect 
by just providing it using `dui add <item_type> (...) -option value`.

A theme called *default* comes included. It provides default aspects corresponding to the Insight visual identity.


Aspects are stored using a 4-word syntax separated by dots, though the last word (&lt;style_name&gt;) is optional:

```tcl
<theme_name>.<type_name>.<option_name>.<style_name>
```

Aspects are defined using `dui aspect add`. The full aspect can be provided, or, more often, the **-theme**,
**-type** and **-style** options are applied to all given arguments. These three calls do the same:

```tcl
dui aspect add -theme dark -type text -style \
	tab_header font_family \
	notosansuiregular font_size 20
	
dui aspect add dark.text.font_family.tab_header notosansuiregular dark.text.font_size.tab_header 20

dui aspect add -theme dark {
	text.font_family.tab_header 
	notosansuiregular text.font_size.tab_header 20
}
```

Example code:

```tcl
package require de1_dui 1.0
dui theme add dark
dui aspect add -theme dark {
    page.bg_color "#edecfa"
    text.font_family notosansuiregular
    text.font_size 16
    text.fill "#7f879a"
    text.activefill orange
    text.disabledfill "#ddd"
    text.anchor nw
    text.justify left 
    text.font_family.tab_header notosansuibold
    text.font_size.tab_header 20
    entry.relief sunken
        ... 
    }

# From now on all aspect defaults will be from the dark theme
dui theme current dark 

# Create a page with the dark theme aspect defaults, so will use page.bg_color from that theme
dui page add test_page

# Will use a bigger font, otherwise will use the theme text.* aspects
dui add dtext test_page 1280 100 -text [translate "Tab title"] -style tab_header

# Will use all text.* aspects from the dark theme, except -fill
dui add dtext test_page 200 200 -text [translate "Some text"] -fill black
```

### Images and sounds

DUI implements 3 facilities for all images that previously were only available for page background images: resizing, caching, and preloading vs delaying load. These are implemented internally by a set of `dui image` subcommands that are not exported, as they are called automatically by DUI when `dui add image` or `dui page load` are used.

**Images finding and resizing**

If a relative path is provided to image commands such as `dui add image`, DUI searches for the file in its image search paths list. By default this includes images in subfolder **&lt;current_screen_width&gt;x&lt;current_screen_height&gt;** of the default skin, then in subfolder **&lt;current_screen_width&gt;x&lt;current_screen_height&gt;** of the active skin. Any other image directory must be explicitly added with `dui image add_dirs`.

If the requested file is not found in any of the search paths, and option  _rescale=1_  is set (the default), then the same file is searched for in the **2560x1600** subfolders and, if found, the image is automatically rescaled and stored in **&lt;current_screen_width&gt;x&lt;current_screen_height&gt;**, so it doesn't have to be rescaled again next time.

Search paths are tried in the order in which they were originally added.

**Images caching**

The first time an image is loaded, it is indexed by its normalized file path. Subsequent usages of the same path image automatically reuse the image that is already loaded. This is automatic and transparent to client code.

**Preloading vs delayed loading**

DUI setting parameter **preload_images** controls whether images are preloaded (loaded into memory from their path names) when they are setup with the `dui image add` command, or whether its loading is delayed until the first time a page in which the image appears is shown. The default value of **preload_images** is initialized by the DE1 app to the value of the global setting **preload_all_page_images**.


#### Images and sounds API
 
<a name="dui_image_add_dirs"></a>

**dui image add_dirs**  _dirname ?dirname ...?_

>Append new folders to the list of directories that will be searched when an image filename with a relative path is provided to **dui add image**. Note that this must be the  _parent_  folder that contains subfolders for each available screen resolution. For the DE1 app, the default image search path includes the default skin folder, and the active skin folder.

### Pages

GUI elements are placed into pages. Internally they are all canvas children that are just initialized in a hidden state.
DUI tracks which elements appear on each page, and shows the right ones when a page is requested to be shown, 
hiding all others.

Each page is just a background element, which can be either a full-page size image or a colored rectangle. This element
receives the same label as the page name. Once the page is added, visual items can be added to it at fixed 
coordinates in a 2560x1600 pixels space. The coordinates and other dimension options are mapped automatically to the 
current resolution.
Note that  _only landscape screen/tablet position is supported_ .

Pages and their child elements are normally built during startup (though they can be perfectly defined later, too), 
then pages are shown or hidden during the app session lifecycle, whenever `dui page show*` commands are used.

Each visual item can appear in more than one page, which makes it easy to build sets of similar pages with just some
differences.

The order in which visual items are added to pages is exactly the same order in which they will be shown. 
This may be very relevant for certain controls. For example, "clickable" areas in a button should always be added
last so they are not hidden totally or partially by other controls (which would make them non-clickable). Of course,
this can be controlled at runtime with canvas commands **lower** and **raise**, but it's usually easier to avoid problems 
adding items in the correct order.

#### Page namespaces

Before DUI, pages creation code was often placed directly in the outermost script of skins and at times scattered through several source code files, making it hard to follow and maintain. Mostly global variables were used for keeping page state and data, which made it too easy to pollute the global context with stuff and was prone to name clashing, especially with the increasing amount of available skins and extensions.

Although this code style is still supported, it is highly recommended that UI code is migrated to use the new **page namespaces**. The idea is to encapsulate the code and the data of each page (or set of related pages) into its own namespace. This not only improves readability and maintenance, but makes it much easier to build pages because DUI supports some conventions that facilitate it:

1. Each page namespace contains by default 2 arrays:
	- The **widgets** array contains handles to all the page visual items, indexed by the first tag name provided in the **-tags** option of each **dui add &lt;type&gt;** command.
	- The **data** array contains page data. Non-qualified variable names in calls to **dui add &lt;type&gt;** commands 	automatically use data from this array (and auto-set it as necessary), simplifying the **dui add** syntax and promoting usage of namespace variables instead of global variables.
2. If the page namespace includes commands whose names match the <a href="#page_actions">page events</a> **setup**, **load**, **show**, **hide** and **update_vars**, they are automatically called by DUI at the specific event.

DUI offers the base namespace **::dui::pages** where page namespaces can be created as children, and uses it as default, but doesn't require you to use it. Any namespace can be used, by declaring it with the **-namespace** option of the <a href="#dui_page_add">dui page add</a> command.

Another advantage of using page namespaces is that pages can be completely rebuilt on the fly, for example to change their aspect to anooher skin. See command <a href="#dui_page_retheme">dui page retheme</a>.


<a name="page_actions"></a>

#### Page actions / events

Page actions are Tcl code callbacks that are executed at different points in the page lifecycle. They are similar to Tk widgets bindings. They serve to customize the application workflow in general or in specific pages.

Page actions can be defined implicitly when using namespaces by defining the namespace commands **setup**, **load**, **show**, **hide** and **update_vars**, or explicitly for any type of page by calls to <a href="#dui_page_add_action">dui page add_action</a>. Note that event actions (either implicit or explicit) **need not be invoked directly**. They are all automatically executed by the DUI framework.

Page actions can apply to individual pages or to all pages (setting the  _page_  argument of **dui page add_action**  to an empty string). The latter serve to modify an application workflow.

Actions are executed in the following order when the event takes place:

1. First, explicit global actions (those that apply to  _all_ pages), in the order in which they were added in the code.
2. Second, the page-specific implicit action (for pages with namespaces, the proc whose name matches the event name).
3. Third, the page-specific explicit actions, in the order in which they were added in the code.

The following action types (or  _events_ ) are available:

##### setup
Takes place when the page user interface is defined, that is, when its widgets and canvas items are created. Setup actions are automatically called during app initialization if the page has been created using <a href="#dui_page_add">dui page add</a>. If a page is added after initialization, its setup events are triggered automatically the first time the page is loaded. They are also invoked whenever the page is deleted and re-created by command <a href="#dui_page_retheme">dui page retheme</a>.

##### load
Takes place whenever a <a href="#dui_page_load">dui page load</a> command is run,  _before_  the
page is actually shown. This proc is normally used to initialize page data, such as loading listboxes contents.With page namespaces, the **load** command can be used to pass opening arguments to the page. The first two arguments of the **load** proc must be the names of the pages to hide and show, plus any extra optional arguments that will be passed through from the <a href="#dui_page_load">dui page load</a> call. 

Though receiving the page to be shown as an argument on the **load** and **show** namespace commands may seem unnecessary, it is required when a single namespace is used for several related pages. Same argument for passing the name of the page to be hidden to the **hide** namespace command.

A page namespace **load** command must return either 0, 1, or a page name. This is used to optionally interrupt the loading of the page (if the return value is 0), or to diverge the flow to another page (if the return value is a new page name).

##### show 
Takes place whenever the <a href="#dui_page_load">dui page load</a> or <a href="#dui_page_show">dui page show</a> commands are run,  _after_  the page is actually shown. This event is normally used to initialize the page GUI elements (e.g. show/hide or enable/disable some items depending on the state).

With page namespaces, the **show** command first two arguments must be the names of the pages to hide and show.
	
##### hide
Takes place just after the currently visible page is going to be hidden, due to <a href="#dui_page_load">dui page load</a> or <a href="#dui_page_show">dui page show</a> commands that will show another page. Page cleanup is usually carried out on this event.

With page namespaces, the **hide** command first two arguments must be the names of the pages to hide and show.

##### update_vars
Takes place whenever the <a href="#dui_add_variable">page variables</a> values are updated. Beware this is a background task that is run very often while the page is visible (around every 100 milliseconds), so write efficient code for this event.

> >DUI will change temporarily the theme to  _theme_name_  while running the page *setup* actions if it differs from the active theme at that moment, and set it back after the page is setup. This means that the theme never needs to be set of modified in the setup actions themselves.

>**-style**  _style_name*

> >Uses as default options the aspects from style  _style_name_  for the **page** type. If an aspect is not defined
for the requested style, the unstyled aspect is used.

>**-bg_img**  _filename_

> >Uses an image as background. At the moment this case is delegated to the legacy proc **add_de1_page**. This has
precedence over **-bg_color**.

>**-bg_color**  _color_spec_

If the namespace does not exist, it is created. If the namespace does not already have the **widgets** and **data** array
variables, they are created. If this option is not specified, it takes its default value from the DUI configuration 
variable **create_page_namespaces**.

During this process, the <a href="#page_actions">page actions</a> **load**, **show**, and **hide** are invoked if they exist in the page namespace; if there are explicit page actions matching the same events, they are invoked too. Each of these 3 callbacks is invoked using as 2 first arguments the name of the page to hide and the name of the page to show. All additional arguments in  _args_  are passed through to the page **load** command and/or to the page load actions. Use this to initialize pages with specific data, or for communication between pages, instead of relying on global variables.

>**dui page show** does the same as **dui page load** except that the **load** actions are not invoked. For example, this can be used when returning from a dialog page, when you want to re-show the page that invoked the dialog without re-loading its data.

### Visual items (GUI elements)

GUI elements can be of two types:

1. **Canvas items**: text, images and painting primitives (lines, arcs, polygons, rectangles and ovals).
They are created directly in the canvas. 
2. **Tk widgets** or "windows": These need to be created before adding them to the canvas. The canvas acts as a 
container and geometry manager.

Each item is created and added to a [page](#pages) using a <strong>dui add &lt;item_type&gt;</strong> command.
These commands are the workhorse of the DUI package, as they try to make it as easy as possible to add GUI
elements, removing as much burden as sensible from client (skin & plugin) code. 

The <strong>dui add &lt;item_type&gt;</strong> family of commands perform a good number of actions:

1. Transform all coordinates and dimensions from a fixed-size space of 2560x1600 to the actual resolution in use.
2. Assign meaningful labels to all visual items added to the canvas, using the canvas tag system. The labels are based 
on the first  element of the list provided by the calling code in the `-tags` argument, or on automatically-generated 
labels if `-tags` is not provided.
3. Assign default values to most widget creation options to define their aspect (font, colors, etc.) using themes
and styles. Client code is thus relieved from having to define each of these options on each call and aspect changes 
can be done globally with just a few lines of code.
4. If the element is a Tk widget, create the widget (which is necessary, before it can be added it to the canvas)
5. Create extra visual items in *compound* GUI controls, such as labels for most widgets, scrollbars for listboxes and 
multiline text entries, images and icons in buttons, etc., and label all of them so they can easily be retrieved later.
6. Create connection code between these items, if necessary. For example, dynamically place scale scrollbars on the side
of listboxes and make them work together with the listbox.
7. Add common utilities (if requested), such as data validation or full-page editors for data input.
8. If page namespaces are used, add references to all created visual items in the page namespace `widgets` array,
and use the namespace `data` array as default for any non-fully qualified variable used in the visual controls.
9. Add the visual items to the canvas, hidden.
10. Assign each visual item to the pages where it should appear.
11. Return the handle of the created item (canvas IDs for canvas items, and pathnames for Tk widgets)


<a name="retrieving_items"></a>

#### Identifying and retrieving items

The canvas widget uses a powerful naming mechanism based of the **-tags** option of the **canvas create** command.
Each item added to the canvas can receive any number of tags, and several items can share the same tag. 
These tags can then be used to retrieve and perform operations on all items that match a given set of tags at once.
In addition, each item added to the canvas is automatically assigned a unique integer ID that can be used to retrieve the item.

Tk widgets, in addition, create a command in the global context based on their pathname. The default pathname
assigned by DUI concatenates the canvas pathname, the page name and the main canvas tag of the widget, for example
_.can.settings_2a-profiles_listbox_ .

For Tk widgets added to the canvas you can retrieve the widget pathname from the canvas ID or tag using 
**[dui canvas] itemcget &lt;tag_or_id&gt; -window**, but not the other way around. Nevertheless, DUI offers
helper methods such as **dui item get**, **dui item get_widget**, **dui item config** and **dui item cget** that
auto-detect item types and work equally with canvas items and Tk widgets, so it's recommended to use them.

Before DUI, the canvas tag mechanism was not accessible because the **add_de1_&lt;type&gt;** commands assigned an 
automatic tag based on counters and didn't allow client code to assign tags. An automatic tag is still assigned
in a similar way if the **dui add &lt;type&gt;** doesn't include a **-tags** option.

The **dui add &lt;type&gt;** family of commands manipulate the tags provided by the user in the following ways:

1. If no tag is specified, an automatic tag is created using auto-increment counters.

2. The first tag in the list of tags is considered the "main tag" and is used to name and retrieve the control.
It can only contain letters, numbers and underscore characters, and is required to be unique  _per page_ . 
This main tag is also used as the key in the page namespace `widgets` array variable, and as default key in the page
namespace `data` array variable when no variable is explicitly defined (for widgets associated to variables, 
such as entries, listboxes or scales).

3. Any extra user tags are added to each of the canvas items created in the call (some **dui add** calls create
not one but several items).

4. DUI itself adds several tags to the list:

  -One `p:<page_name>` tag per page in which the item appears. This is internally used to locate items in pages, find out which ones to show when a page has to be shown, etc.
	
  -One common `<main_tag>*` tag to all canvas items created in the call. This is useful for control "compounds", such as an entry and its label; a listbox, its label and its crollbars; or each line, rectangle, oval, and text items used to create canvas-based controls such as rounded-rectangle buttons or dsliders. Using this notation, all individual items in a compound can be shown, hidden, enabled, disabled, recolored or moved at once using calls like **dui item enable espresso pressure_chart*** while still retaining the possibility of accessing and modifying each of the invididual elements.
  
  -For Tk widgets, the widget pathname is added as a tag, to allow "reverse searching" from pathnames to canvas IDs.

#### Visual items API

<a name="dui_item"></a>

#### `dui item`

The **dui item** ensemble includes most commands to deal with visual GUI elements, except those dealing with creating the items and adding them to pages. Because the **dui add** are so often used, the shorthand **dui add** is offered (yet **dui item add** also works).

The following commands form the exported API of `dui item`, but the ensemble includes a good number of extra commands that are not exported but can still be accessed using fully qualified calls such as **::dui::item::relocate_txt_wrt**. These are normally only used internally by other DUI procs, but may on occasion be useful for client code too, for example if it builds its own sets of compound widgets. Their usage is documented in the source code.

**dui item get**  _page tags_

>Return the unique canvas IDs of the requested items. If only one argument is given, it is interpreted as either a list of canvas IDs or a list of widget pathnames. In both cases, the same values are returned after validation, i.e. only if they correspond to existing objects. While this form may not seem very useful, it is provided mainly to be used from other commands that may receive either an element of the *widgets* page namespace array, or a page+tag combination.

>The two-arguments call is more commonly used by final code, and return the  _unique_  canvas IDs of the items matching  _tags_  in the requested  _page_ . If  _page_  is a list with several pages, only the first one is used. Add "*" to a main tag name to return all the items in a widget compound. Use `all` or an empty string as  _tags_  to return the IDs of all the page elements.

By default show or hides items only in the currently active page, and does nothing if the item does not appear in the current page. Showing or hiding by default also only affects the current state of the widget, but does not affect its initial state (how it will appears the next time a page that includes the item is shown). Use the  **-initial**  option to alter the initial state.

<a name="dui_add"></a>

#### `dui add`

##### Common options

A few **dui add** commands just offer convenience shorthands to other commands, such as **dui add theme** or **dui add page**, but most procs are used to add GUI elements to pages. All those share a number of options that are listed here instead of listing them for every command.

**pages**

>A list with the pages where the item will be shown. The pages must have been declared previously using  **dui page add**. Note that adding an item to several pages does not duplicate the item. Only one instance of each visual item will be created, and that instance will be shown or hidden as relevant for the current visible page.

**{coords}**

>Normally the **x** and **y** coordinates where the item must be placed, in a 2560x1600 pixels space that will be mapped to the actual resolution in use. Some items like canvas lines or rectangles may take additional coordinates. 
>Note that canvas items and widgets must be placed in fixed locations, unlike other geometry managers like [grid](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/grid.htm). While this works great in most DE1 app pages, it's not ideal under some circunstances. Most notable is when using text-based data input, as the dimensions of entries or listboxes widgets are defined in number of characters (which are font-dependent) and not in pixels, and other widgets must be placed on their right or bottom sides. A few workarounds for these cases are:
>1. Use pixel instead of character dimensions, using the **-canvas_width** and **-canvas_height** options instead of the **-width** and **-height** options of widgets like entries and listboxes.
>2. Reposition items relative to others dynamically, using procs such as the (non exported) **::dui::item::relocate_text_wrt** or **::dui::item::set_yscrollbar_dim**. Because the actual dimensions of items are not accessible until the page is painted for the first time, these must be called on the page **show** command or **show** event action.
>3. Create a Tk frame inside the canvas and manage its geometry with **grid** or other geometry manager.

**-tags**  _tag_list_

>Tags are essential for accessing and modifying GUI elements after they are created. The first tag in  _tag_list_  uniquely identifies the item (or set of items if it's a  _compound_ ). It is required to be unique  _per page_ , and can only have letters, numbers and underscores. There are no restrictions on the rest of tags in the list (except those imposed by the canvas itself). In addition to the tags defined in the **dui add** call, DUI adds some tags of its own to identify item compounds and the pages in which each item appears.

>If page namespaces are used, the first (=main) tag is used as the key in the **widgets** and **data** namespace array variables. **$::&lt;page_namespace&gt;::data(&lt;main_tag&gt;)** is also used (and auto initialized) as default variable for widgets that take a global variable name (such as entries, listboxes, scales, etc.), when the variable is not explicitly defined in the call.

**-variable**  _variable_name_

**-textvariable**  _variable_name_

**-listvariable**  _variable_name_

>Name of the global variable whose value will be shown in the widget. Editing in the widget modifies the variable value, and if the variable value changes anywhere, then the widget will automatically update itself to reflect the new value.

>If not specified in the call and a page namespace is used, uses `::<page_namespace>::data(<main_tag>)`.

>If a plain name is given (only letters, numbers and underscores) and a page namespace is used, uses `::<page_namespace>::data(<textvariable>)`.

>If the text **%NS** is found in the variable name and a page namespace is used, it is substituted by the page namespace.

**-theme**  _theme_

>The [theme](#aspects) used to get the default values for the creation options ("aspects") that are not directly specified in the call. This is normally not used, as by default the currently active theme is used, but may be used exceptionally to format some pages using a theme different from the one in use.

>Use the special value "**none**" as  _theme_  to not apply any aspects to the visual item.


**-style**  _style_

>The [style](#aspects) used to get default values for the creation options ("aspects") that are not directly specified in the call. Styles are used to have different visual aspects or "versions" of the same item type, for example, to have different types of buttons (with different colors, sizes, or positioning of the inside label and icon)

**-font_family**  _family_

**-font_size**  _size_

**-font_weight**  _normal_or_bold_

**-font_slant**  _roman_or_italic_

**-font_underline**  _true_or_false_

**-font_overstrike**  _true_or_false_

>All elements that use text will accept this set of individual font options. Note that without DUI these cannot be passed individually to creation commands but must be embedded in the **-font** option. DUI allows you to specify each one individually so that most can be taken from the theme/type/style and the client code can modify only one or a few of them when needed.

>Font sizes can be  _relative_ . If  _size_  is a number prefixed by "-" or "+", the size will be decreased or increased with respect to the default theme/type/style font size.

**-canvas_***option*** **  _value_

>When creating Tk widgets with a **dui add** command, most options are passed through to the widget **create** command. The set of  **-canvas_* ** options serve to pass some options to the **canvas create** command instead. This is useful, for example, to override the width and height in characters of text-based widgets and use pixel sizes instead (e.g. **-canvas_width 200 -canvas_height 450**) or to change the default "nw" anchoring (e.g. **-canvas_anchor center**).

**-tclcode**  _tcl_code_

>For Tk widgets, Tcl code that will be evaluated after the widget is created, for example to allow configuring the widget. Note that this is evaluated in the **dui add** proc local context, not in the global context.

>The following substitutions are available:

> >-**%W**: Substituted by the widget pathname.

> >-**%NS**: Substituted by the page namespace, is one is used, or an empty string otherwise.

> _DESIGN NOTE_ : This is maintained at the moment for backwards compatibility, but evaluating this code in the creation proc context seems pretty unsafe, as it can modify any local variable. Given that DUI provides the mechanisms to easily access the created widgets once they're created, maintaining this doesn't seem really necessary.

**-initial_state**  _state_

>This is used to define what should be the initial state of the item  _whenever the page is shown_ . Normally not needed, as it defaults to  _normal_  and most page elements are shown when showing the page. Useful when some items may be hidden or disabled depending of the situation, because it is better to hide or disable them initially and then conditionally show or enable them than doing the reverse (which was the only option before DUI) to avoid the flickering effect of something appearing and rapidly disappearing from the page.

**-label_** _option_   _value_

**-symbol_** _option_   _value_

**-yscrollbar_** _option_   _value_

>When a **dui add** command creates a control  _compound_ , use the corresponding prefix on the option names to pass those options to the "sub-item" creation command.

<a name="dui_add_canvas_item"></a>

**dui add canvas_item**  _type pages x y ?{extra_coords}? ?-option value ...?_

>Generic command to add canvas items of type  _type_  to DUI pages. Some canvas items like **text** or **image** have their own **dui add** command with extra features, but this is offered for extensions and for adding items such as lines or ovals that don't have their own **dui add** command.


<a name="dui_add_widget"></a>

**dui add widget**  _type pages x y ?-option value ...?_

>Generic command to create Tk widgets of type  _type_  and add them to DUI pages. Many widgets like **entry** or **listbox** have their own **dui add** command with extra features, but this is offered for extensions and other non directly supported widgets.


<a name="dui_add_dtext"></a>

**dui add dtext**  _pages x y ?-option value ...?_

>Create a text label and add it to the requested  _pages_  at coordinates  _{x, y}_ . 

>Non-DUI options are passed-through to [canvas create text](https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl/TkCmd/canvas.htm#M156).

>**-command**  _true_or_false_or_tcl_code_

> >Runs  _tcl_code_  when the text is clicked. If 1 or true or yes, and a page namespace command exists with the same name as the main tag, it will the command invoked. If it is a plain name (letters, numbers and underscores only) and the name matches a namespace command, it will be the command invoked.


<a name="dui_add_variable"></a>

**dui add variable**  _pages x y ?-option value ...?_

>Create a text label whose contents are updated dynamically and add it to the requested  _pages_  at coordinates  _{x, y}_ . 

>Non-DUI options are passed-through to [canvas create text](https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl/TkCmd/canvas.htm#M156).

>**-textvariable**  _tcl_code_

> >Callback Tcl code that returns the string to be shown. This will be evaluated continuously while the page is shown and on the idle state, updating the text whenever the result of the evaluation changes. If the page has a namespace and  _tcl_code_  is a plain name (only letters, numbers and underscores, no brackets etc.), or if no **-textvariable** is provided at all (in this case the main tag will be used), then the callback will be `{$::<page_namespace>::data(<tcl_code_or_main_tag>)}`.

> >You can use `%NS` anywhere in  _tcl_code_  and it will be substituted by the page namespace.

>**-command**  _true_or_false_or_tcl_code_

> >Runs  _tcl_code_  when the text is clicked. If 1 or true or yes, and a page namespace command exists with the same name as the main tag, it will the command invoked. If it is a plain name (letters, numbers and underscores only) and the name matches a namespace command, it will be the command invoked.

> >In addition to standard substitutions, **%NS** is substituted by the page namespace.

<a name="dui_add_image"></a>

**dui add image**  _pages x y filename ?-option value ...?_

>Create an image from a file and add it to the requested  _pages_  at coordinates  _{x, y}_ . 

>If  _filename_  doesn't specify the full path, the image is searched for sequentially in subfolder &lt;screen_size_width&gt;x&lt;screen_size_height&gt; of each of the image directories added with **dui add image_dirs** until a match is found. If not found, it is then searched in the subfolder for the base screen resolution &lt;1280x1600&gt; and, if found, rescaled on the fly to the target screen resolution. The rescaled image is saved so next time it is just read from disk.

>Non-DUI options are passed-through to [image create](https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl/TkCmd/image.htm). The default image type is **photo**.

>Images are loaded only once to reduce memory usage. A dictionary is kept with the normalized path of every loaded image so that, if it is added again to the canvas, the already loaded image is used. 

>Images are actually loaded from their files either at setup time or at page load time (the first time a page that contains the image is shown). Use the second option to reduce app startup time. This is controlled by the DUI configuration setting **preload_images**.


<a name="dui_add_dbutton"></a>

**dui add dbutton**  _pages x y ?x1 y1? ?-option value ...?_

>Create a "dui button" (a rectangular "clickable" area) from canvas primitive shapes and add it to the requested  _pages_  at coordinates  _{x y}_ . 

>The button background can be invisible (if no options are provided) or it can have different shapes depending on the **-shape** option. 

>Return the list of all canvas IDs that form the button compound. The command also adds (if applicable) the following named tags to the canvas, and the same keys in the widgets page namespace array: 

> >&lt;main_tag&gt;: the invisible "clickable" rectangle;

> >&lt;main_tag&gt;-btn: the background button shape, which may itself be composed of several canvas items such as lines, rectangles and ovals;

> >&lt;main_tag&gt;-lbl, &lt;main_tag&gt;-lbl1, etc.: (optional) label text;

> >&lt;main_tag&gt;-sym, &lt;main_tag&gt;-sym1, etc.: (optional) symbol text.

> >&lt;main_tag&gt;-img, &lt;main_tag&gt;-img1, etc.: (optional) image.

>During development, especially with invisible background buttons, you may want to set the global DUI configuration variable **debug_buttons** to 1 using `dui config debug_buttons 1`, as this will make the clickable area visible by drawing the button border. If the default black color of this border is not visible against the theme background, you can change it by modifying the **debug_outline** dbutton aspect (i.e. `dui aspect set -type dbutton debug_outline yellow`).

>**-bwidth**  _width_

>**-bheight**  _height_

> >Normally button dimensions are defined giving the rectangle top-left coordinates  _{x y}_  and bottom-down coordinates  _{x1 y1}_ , but  _{x1 y1}_  can be replaced by named options **-bwidth** and **-bheight**. This is most often used for defining a dbutton style for buttons that are always the same size.  _width_  and  _height_  must be pixel sizes in a 2560x1600 screen, and they are transformed automatically to the actual resolution.

>**-anchor**  _anchor_value_

> >If  _x1_  and  _y1_  are not defined (so, **-bwidth** and **-bheight** are used),  _anchor_value_  defines the alignment of the dbutton with respect to the coordinates  _{x y}_ . Anchor valid values are center, n, ne, nw, s, se, sw, w, and e. Default is "nw" (i.e.  _{x y}_  are the top-left coordinates).

>**-shape**  _shape_

> >Shape determines how the background button should be painted, and it accepts the following values:

> >-empty string: no background / invisible clickable area.

> >-**rect**: A rectangle. This accepts as formatting options those taken by **canvas create rect**.

> >-**oval**: An oval. This accepts as formatting options those taken by **canvas create oval**.

> >-**round**: A rounded-corners filled rectangle. This type of button cannot have a border (outline). It is the type of buttons used in the Metric and MimojaCafe skins. It accepts as formatting options **-fill** (button fill color), **-disabledfill** (button fill color when disabled) and **-radius** (determines how "round" the rectangle corners are).

> >-**outline**: A rounded-corners rectangle with a visible outline border. In this case, the fill color is that of the background, and cannot be modified. This is the type of button used in the DSx skin. It accepts as formatting options **-outline** (color of the outline), **-disabledoutline** (color of the outline when the button is disabled), **-arc_offset** (determines how "round" the rectangle corners are) and **-width** (line width of the outline border).

>**-command**  _tcl_code_

> >Callback Tcl code to run when the button is clicked. When the page has a namesapce, if a plain name is used (only letters, numbers and underscores) and the namespace has a command with that name, it is used. If not specified and the page namespace has a command with the same number as the main tag, it is used.

> >In addition to the standard substitutions, DUI adds the following:

> >**%NS**: The page namespace, if defined.

> >**%x0, %y0, %x1, %y1**: top-left and botton-right coordinates of the button rectangle.

>**-label**  _text_

>**-label_pos**  _{horizontal_percentage vertical_percentage}_

>**-label&lt;i&gt;_pos**  _{horizontal_percentage vertical_percentage}_

> >Determines the location of the label inside the button rectangle, given by horizontal and vertical percentages. For example, for placing a label in the center of the button, use `-label_pos {0.5 0.5}` (and, probably, also `-label_anchor center`).

>Create a BLT graph widget and add it to the requested  _pages_  at coordinates  _{x, y}_ . Returns the created command name. Non-DUI options are passed-through to the [BLT graph](http://blt.sourceforge.net/) command.

>Most configuration of BLT graphs is not done in the **dui add graph** command, but through subcommands of the created widget, so you need to get the reference to the graph widget. This is returned from the call, can be retrieved by DUI using the page and tag, or, if using page namespaces, from the `widgets` namespace array. Like this:

```tcl
set widget [dui add graph <pages> <x> <y> -background ....]
$widget axis configure ...
$widget element create ...
```

>or 

```tcl
dui add graph <pages> <x> <y> -tags mygraph ...
(...)
set widget [dui item get_widget <page> mygraph]
$widget axis configure ...
$widget element create ...
```

>One tricky part of graphs is how to apply DUI styling to elements like axis or lines that are not created in the **dui add graph** call but afterwards. The **-as_options yes** argument of **dui aspect list** is intended for these cases, and can be applied as follows:

```tcl
$widget element create line_history_left_chart -xdata <xdata> -ydata <ydata> \
