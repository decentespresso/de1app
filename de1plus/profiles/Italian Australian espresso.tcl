profile_notes {Italians in Australia have a style all their own. They still use dark roasted coffee beans and extract at 9 bar, but they lower the brew temperature so as to not overextract the coffee.  Aim for a brew ratio of 2.5x, which is to say an in-cup weight that is 2.5x the weight of the coffee ground dose.}
